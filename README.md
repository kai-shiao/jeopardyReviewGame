<ul>
	<li>A simple interactive, jQuery, one-player flashcard review game for AP US History.</li>
	<li>The review material used in this game came straight from my old course notes while still in high school in Texas.</li>
	<li>This web game uses Jeopardy!'s format by replicating the screen appearance & prize values; the main divergence is that this version is only for 1 player.
	and obviously, prize money does not translate to real-life prize earnings!</li>
	<li>Instead of using jQuery's fade effects, I used CSS animations for faster performance and thus requiring less capacity on memory.</li>
